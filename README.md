### Hey ðŸ‘‹

My absolute favorite language is Rust (not that proficient though xD) although I use most of the time other languages because its just more time efficient.
But I love the feeling of coding in rust ig xD


Currently I discovered through Advent Of Code some coding puzzles and yeah here is my codewars stats lol. By the time I wrote this 
I had a lot of fun doing them so maybe this will last a week lol (lasted 2 actually xD)
