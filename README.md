### Hey ðŸ‘‹

I'm bored most of the time and just wasting my time with random stuff.

My absolute favorite language is Rust although I use most of the time other languages because its just more time efficient.
But I love the feeling by coding in rust ig xD


Currently I discovered through Advent Of Code some coding puzzles and yeah here is my codewars stats lol. My the time I write this 
I have a lot of fun doing them so maybe this will last a week lol
